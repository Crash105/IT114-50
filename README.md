# Project Title: DynamicChat
## Forked a Java Chatroom Project from my Advanced Programming for Information Technology Course from a previous Github Acccount
## During this Project: 
- Developed server initiation functionality for seamless start-up via IDE or command line, ensuring smooth connections and message reception
- Enhanced server capabilities to facilitate dynamic user interactions, including the implementation of engaging features like "/flip" for coin toss simulations and "/roll" for dice rolling
- Designed intuitive UI panels for server connection and chatroom interaction, optimizing user experiences with simplified navigation
- Implemented room functionality, allowing users to create or join specific chat rooms for focused discussions and collaboration
- Created and managed a GitHub repository, regularly pushing updates to track and maintain the progress of web application development, and provided access for my professor to grade my work

## How to utilize this Java Project
## Use JDK-17(This is because this project was made in Mid 2022)
## To use the chatroom function of web application, you must:
- Create a split Git bash
- cd to IT114-50
- In first Git bash terminal type javac Project/Server.java and then java Project.Server [port](I use port 3000)
- In the second Git bash terminal type javac Project/Client.java and then Java Project.Client,
- After Java Project.Client, type /name your_name(You can give it any name), Then type /conenct localhost 3000[use your own port]
- You will then see your messages in both the server and client git bash terminals
