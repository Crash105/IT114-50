# Project Title: DynamicChat
## Forked a Java Chatroom Project from my Advanced Programming for Information Technology Course from a previous Github Acccount
## During this Project: 
- Developed server initiation functionality for seamless start-up via IDE or command line, ensuring smooth connections and message reception
- Enhanced server capabilities to facilitate dynamic user interactions, including the implementation of engaging features like "/flip" for coin toss simulations and "/roll" for dice rolling
- Designed intuitive UI panels for server connection and chatroom interaction, optimizing user experiences with simplified navigation
- Implemented room functionality, allowing users to create or join specific chat rooms for focused discussions and collaboration
- Created and managed a GitHub repository, regularly pushing updates to track and maintain the progress of web application development, and provided access for my professor to grade my work
